Purpose of this game: An alien spacecraft drives through a solar system on its way home.
But first, it has to cross a field of asteroids and other celestrial bodies.
Each hit by an asteroid costs ufo energie. But there is the possibility to gain energie by firing on the fuelcanns, cups of coffee and ciamon stars, which come with the asteroids.
The game is over, when the ufo reaches the last planet. The game score is the remaining energy.
